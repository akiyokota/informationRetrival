<h4><strong>CSE Shines in New NRC Rankings</strong></h4>
<p>The National Research Council's long-awaited ranking of PhD programs, widely accepted as the gold standard, places CSE's in the top echelons of programs nationwide. Our relatively young program places well ahead of many solidly-established national leaders. This is not surprising - these rankings are based on actual data for 20 quality metrics, while typical rankings are greatly influenced by perception. CSE excels in Research, as well as in overall ranking of program quality. NRC's rankings have been designed not to skew in favor of large programs, a typical bias in most rankings. CSE's outstanding per-capita productivity allows CSE to showcase its quality. NRC uses two ranking approaches, called the S- and the R-rankings, respectively. S-rankings are computed by asking respondents how each of the 20 quality metrics should be weighted while the R-ranking method first obtains ratings for a set of programs by asking respondents to rate random subsets. It then derives the weights implicit in these ratings by regressing the program ratings against the values for the metrics.&nbsp; See for yourself how well <a href="http://graphics.cs.ucr.edu/misc/nrc_cse.pdf">CSE compares with other programs in the University of California, as well as nationwide</a>.&nbsp; For more information on the process and to download the data, see the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/Resdoc/index.htm">NRC</a> website.</p>

<h4><strong>CSE Researchers Discover Relationship between Twitter and Financial Markets</strong></h4>
<p>CSE Professor Vagelis Hristidis, CSE PhD student Eduardo Ruiz and their collaborators found that the Twitter activity is correlated with the exchanged volume and price of stocks in the stock market. In particular, they found that the more distinct topics, which they refer as "connected components", are discussed about a company, the higher its exchange volume. They also found a weaker correlation with the stock price. Using this technique to augment a trading strategy led to better profitability in a limited study. This study introduces novel ways to quantify the activity in microblogging networks by leveraging the relationships between users, posts and topics. The techniques employed can potentially be used to study the relationship of microblogging activity to other applications like public health monitoring or detecting social trends. The findings of this study have been covered by many media, including <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/03/22/twitter-chatter-can-predict-stock-prices-study-finds/">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/study-twitter-help-predict-winners-losers-stock-market-213800175.html">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/9168665/Twitter-helps-investors-play-the-stock-market.html">The Telegraph (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/want-to-check-the-markets-see-whats-trending-7586375.html">The Independent (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2120416/Twitter-predicts-stock-prices-accurately-investment-tactic-say-scientists.html">Daily Mail (UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2012/03/26/news/twitter_predice_aziende-32232684/">La Republicca (Italy)</a>, Univision TV, and NewsTalk 92.5 FM.</p>

<h4><strong>CSE's Harsha Madhyastha Receives NSF CAREER Award</strong></h4>
<p>Assistant professor Harsha Madhyastha has been awarded a CAREER award by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The CAREER program identifies outstanding new faculty whose vision aims to significantly advance the state of the art in both research and education. Madhyastha will receive a total of $499,309 over five years to fund his efforts in enabling cost-effective deployments of applications in the cloud. Today, the performance and availability of any application deployed on the cloud is limited by the characteristics of the cloud service on which the application is deployed. Madhyastha's work will develop novel algorithms and software systems that will enable application providers to obtain better availability and performance, while keeping costs low, by planning and managing application deployments that span multiple cloud services. Madhyastha's CAREER award winning project also has a significant education component with the introduction of new graduate and undergraduate classes, and public talks to increase awareness about cloud services among small and non-profit businesses.</p>

Professor <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/">Vassilis Tsotras</a> is part of a team from UC Irvine, UC Riverside and UC San Diego that are targeting the problems related to semistructured data with an emphasis on scale. The team brings together five researchers drawn from the three UC campuses, with expertise spanning structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. The National Science Foundation is providing $2.7 million to design and implement an open source platform to be shared and used by research groups around the country who have semistructured information management needs.</p>
