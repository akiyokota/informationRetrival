<p>Bourns College of Engineering faculty and students ended the academic year 2013-14 with numerous grants, awards and honors that demonstrated the college's commitment to excellence in research and teaching.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Project team" src="/images/Grill%20team%20web%20300.jpg" alt="Project team" width="300" height="199" />A team BCOE students have designed a tray that when placed under the grates of a backyard grill reduces by 70 percent the level of a harmful pollutant produced during cooking. The students – Dennis Nguyen, Greg Brinley, Elizabeth Mende, Kyle Russell and Justin Tao, all of whom just graduated – won a phase-one grant of $15,000 as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's P3 (People, Prosperity and the Planet) competition. Next year a new group of students will take over the project and compete for a $90,000 phase two grant. The students were advised by Lecturer Kawai Tam and David Cocker, a professor of chemical and environmental engineering. They conducted their research in the cooking emissions lab at the College of Engineering-Center for Environmental Research and Technology. <a href="http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/23875">Full story at UCR Today</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Project team" src="/images/Mower%20team%20web%20300.jpg" alt="Project team" width="300" height="199" />Another group of recent graduates –Timothy Chow, Brian Cruz, Jonathan Matson and Wartini Ng –&nbsp;also won a phase-one grant of $15,000 as part of the P3 competition for a device they created that curbs a harmful pollutant emitted from lawnmowers by 93 percent. The EPA estimates that a gasoline-powered lawn mower emits 11 times the air pollution of a new car for each hour of operation. Next year a new group of students – Anna Almario, Priyanka Singh and Alyssa Yan – will take over the project and compete for a $90,000 phase-two grant. The students were also advised by Tam and Cocker, along with Phillip Christopher, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering. <a href="http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/23616">Full story at UCR Today</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Tile project team" src="/images/Tiles%20team%20at%20EPA%20web%20300.jpg" alt="Tile project team" width="300" height="189" />Another team of BCOE students – Carlos Espinoza, Louis Lancaster, Chun-Yu "Jimmy" Liang, Kelly McCoy, Jessica Moncayo and Edwin Rodriguez – received an honorable mention award for phase two of the P3 competition for creating a roof tile coating that when applied to an average-sized residential roof breaks down the same amount of smog-causing nitrogen oxides per year as a car driven 11,000 miles. They calculated 21 tons of nitrogen oxides would be eliminated daily if tiles on one million roofs were coated with their titanium dioxide mixture. They also calculated it would cost only about $5 for enough titanium dioxide to coat an average-sized residential roof. The student team that worked on the project last year received $15,000 as a phase-one award. That team consisted of William Lichtenberg, Duc Nguyen, Calvin Cao, Vincent Chen and Espinoza (now a graduate student at UC Riverside). Both teams were advised by Tam and Cocker. <a href="http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/22621">Full story at UCR Today</a>.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Mahesh Neupane poster" src="/images/neupane_web_325.jpg" alt="Mahesh Neupane poster" width="325" height="243" />Ph.D. candidate Mahesh R. Neupane (pictured in poster) was awarded second prize for his research work titled, "Effect of Misorientation on the Electronic Properties of vdW Materials" at the 95th AAAS Pacific Division Conference June 16-20, 2014, at UCR. The award include a cash prize, an award certificate and a lifetime membership in the research honor society Sigma Xi. Co-authors include Darshana Wickramaratne, Supeng Ge, Gen Yin and Shanshan Su, all of whom are Ph.D. students in Professor of Electrical Engineering Roger Lake's research group.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Sandeep Dhall" src="/images/Sandeep%20Dhall.jpg" alt="Sandeep Dhall" width="143" height="149" />Sandeep Dhall, a Ph.D. candidate in bioengineering, was awarded the Young Investigator Award at the 2014 annual meeting of the Wound Healing Society in Orlando, Florida, in April. In May, he also received the Vince Del Pizzo Student Leadership and Service Award at UCR, which is named after Vincent Del Pizzo, who served as an assistant vice chancellor of student affairs over the span of three decades, promoting student leadership and development and enriching the lives of students and the campus. <a href="http://www.bioeng.ucr.edu/news/2014/2014-05-27.html">Read more at the Department of Bioengineering website</a>.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="MWD ECO Innovation team" src="/images/MWD%20ECO%20team%20web%20300.jpg" alt="MWD ECO Innovation team" width="300" height="212" />Sustainability and renewable energy projects developed by students of the Bourns College of Engineering captured top recognition at Metropolitan Water District's second annual ECO Innovators Showcase competition in May. First place in the team category went to BCOE students Christian Alcaraz, Julianne Rolf, Ryan Schoeman, and Samantha Mak whose project involved using renewable energy to dry clothes, provide space heating and humidify homes in a low-income community development in Moreno Valley. The competition was part of Metropolitan's 7th annual Spring Green Expo, an educational event featuring more than 70 exhibits by college students, businesses and public agencies at Metropolitan's downtown Los Angeles headquarters building. The contest attracted projects from 20 universities and community colleges throughout Southern California in individual and team categories. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/ca-metropolitan-water-idUSnBw025967a+100+BSW20140502">Read the MWD's news release at Reuter's</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the end of the year, faculty were part of more than $16 million in research grants from the National Science Foundation and other agencies. The project are described below.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" src="/images/ashok.jpg" alt="Ashok Mulchandani" width="120" height="180" /><img class="img_R" title="Xin Ge" src="/images/xge.jpg" alt="Xin Ge" width="120" height="180" />Xin Ge and Ashok Mulchandani (chemical and environmental engineering) serve as co-principal investigators on the $352,000 project "Spore-Based Designer Enzyme Cascade Biocatalysts." Enzyme catalysts would be widely utilized to perform chemical transformation processes, as they frequently offer advantages of high yield, high selectivity, high product purity, along with operation at ambient temperature and pressure in aqueous environment at moderate pH. However, many biocatalytic reactions involve expensive co-enzymes or co-factors and their recycling is essential for the processes to be cost-effective. Ge and Mulchandani looked to cellular reactions in nature to develop an approach to circumvent this issue. Inspired by the substrate channeling phenomena seen in multi-enzyme cascades in nature for circumventing unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics, they will explore the development of a modular designer biocatalyst platform on the surface of spores, where enzyme cascade is spatially organized with tunable stoichiometry to achieve highly efficient cofactor regeneration.</p>
<p>Mulchandani also received the 2013–14 Doctoral Dissertation Mentoring Award from UC Riverside's Academic Senate. Mulchandani has advised 49 graduate students (including 39 Ph.D. students), more than 38 postdocs and 40 undergraduate researchers. His students have uniformly praised him for his outstanding contributions to their graduate education and training, describing him as a "highly knowledgeable adviser, life-time mentor and wonderful friend."</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Jianzhong Wu" src="/images/wu.jpg" alt="Jianzhong Wu" width="120" height="180" />Jianzhong Wu (chemical and environmental engineering) was awarded $429,350 for his project "Theory and Application of Polyelectrolyte Complexation," which seeks to calculate the properties of polymeric electrolytes that are central to bio-medically relevant systems, such as drug delivery, gene knockout, and viral replication. Among the goals of the computations is to establish a new calculational procedure capable of predicting the atomistic structure, thermodynamic stability, and environmental responses of polyelectrolyte complexes under various aqueous conditions.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Bahman Anvari" src="/images/anvari2.jpg" alt="Bahman Anvari" width="120" height="180" />Professor of Bioengineering Bahman Anvari has been awarded $220,000 for a collaborative research project, "A new paradigm for ovarian cancer imaging and therapy." Anvari and his colleagues propose the use of a new optical nano-probe, composed of biological and organic materials, for imaging and laser-based treatment of ovarian tumors in a mouse model. The knowledge gained through this study has broader significance and importance towards the development of an integrated imaging system that can potentially become part of routine standard of care for early detection of ovarian cancer, a significant public health problem.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Laxmi Bhuyan" src="/images/bhuyan.jpg" alt="Laxmi Bhuyan" width="120" height="180" />Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Laxmi Bhuyan was awarded $498,976 for his work on "Efficient CPU-GPU Communication for Heterogeneous Architectures." The proposed heterogeneous architecture will enable future chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to operate within their power budgets while providing the high-throughput per watt required for large scientific applications. The project will develop new CPU-GPU communication techniques through static programming and run-time optimization and develop a divisible load theory (DLT) technique to overlap communication with computation, and optimize the time and size of data transfer between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Robert Haddon" src="/images/HaddonWeb150.jpg" alt="Robert Haddon" width="150" height="203" />Distinguished Professor of Chemical and Environmental Engineering Robert Haddon was awarded $349,995 for his project, "Electro-Optics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: Physics and Applications." Haddon will explore the physics of electro-optical phenomena in films of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SC-SWNTs) and their device applications. The SWNT thin films constitute the ideal medium for studying electro-optical phenomena, because they possess the same fundamental physical properties as individual SWNTs, but also allow the application of a variety of characterization techniques and offer the possibility of the development of a new class of SWNT thin film based electro-optical devices.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Guillermo Aguilar" src="/images/aguilar.jpg" alt="Guillermo Aguilar" width="120" height="180" />Professor and Chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering Guillermo Aguilar was awarded $225,346 for his project "Understanding Laser-Assisted Surface Cooling Enhancement (LASCE)," which will study and develop a non-intrusive method to enhance local heat transfer between a target surface and a cooling fluid. The approach takes advantage of thermocavitation bubbles, which are formed when continuous wave (CW) laser light is properly focused within highly-absorbing liquid thin films. The project can open the door to many transformative applications of optical thermocavitation aimed at low-temperature combustion strategies for mitigating the levels of NOx and particulate matter emissions to improve engine efficiency as well as transdermal drug delivery for diverse biomedical applications.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Ian Wheeldon" src="/images/iwheeldon.jpg" alt="Ian Wheeldon" width="120" height="180" />Ian Wheeldon, assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering received $302,403 for his work on "Intracellular localization of biosynthetic pathways for conversion of lipids to dicarboxylic acids in oleaginous yeast." This collaborative project aims to develop an advanced bio-manufacturing process to convert low cost feedstocks such as waste glycerol or biomass-derived sugars into important precursors for specialty polymers, adhesives, anti-corrosive coatings, and fragrances. In addition to the scientific and engineering goals of this project, educational outreach activities will connect graduate, undergraduate, and community college students in Riverside County, Calif., with students in South Carolina.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="William Grover" src="/images/wgrover.jpg" alt="William Grover" width="120" height="180" /><img class="img_L" src="/images/rodgers_big.jpg" alt="Victor Rodgers" width="120" height="180" />Assistant Professor William Grover and Professor Victor G. Rodgers in the Department of Bioengineering are co-principal investigators on the project "Microfluidic building blocks for bioinstrumentation," which was awarded $200,000 by the NSF. The funding will allow them to develop "microfluidic building blocks," a library of parts that can be connected to build custom microfluidic instruments quickly and easily. Microfluidics (the manipulation of fluids on the microliter scale) has enabled important applications in the biological and health sciences, but currently each of these applications uses a custom-made microfluidic "chip" designed and fabricated by a specialist trained in the art of microfabrication using costly and specialized equipment. As educational tools, microfluidic building blocks could enhance science and engineering curricula from grade school through university. By assembling blocks into working instruments that accomplish certain tasks, students can learn principles of physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Alexander Balandin" src="/images/Balandin.jpg" alt="Alexander Balandin" width="167" height="243" />Professor of Electrical Engineering&nbsp;Alexander Balandin was awarded $168,000 for his work on "Genetic Algorithm Driven Hybrid Computational/Experimental Engineering of Defects in Designer Materials," a collaborative project to build a computational framework with experimental validation to systematically engineer designer materials that provide targeted properties. Defects in materials significantly influence their properties. In this research, computational and experimental approaches will be integrated to construct designer defect-engineered materials that will provide desired properties.</p>
<p>Balandin is also part of a multidisciplinary, seven-university team led by UCR Professor of Physics Jing Shi that are developing an Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) called "Spins and Heat in Nanoscale Electronic Systems" (SHINES). The team will receive $12 million over four years from the Department of Energy and will investigate several aspects of basic research including new ultrathin films, nanostructured composites, high resolution imaging, the transport of electrical signals, heat and light. Other BCOE faculty and researchers on the project include Javier Garay (mechanical engineering) and Roger Lake and Alexander Khitun (electrical engineering).</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Victor Zordan" src="/images/zordan.jpg" alt="Victor Zordan" width="120" height="180" />Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Victor Zordan will use a $100,000 grant to investigate "Computational Design and 3D Printing of Textiles." Because textile prototyping and design (whether for garments, upholstery or composite materials) is an arduous and expensive process, Zordan will seek to understand and advance the role of new additive manufacturing technologies (commonly referred to as "3D printing") in the design and prototyping of textile products. His goal is to develop 3D printing hardware and computer software that enable engineers to prototype textile designs more quickly and economically, and with greater control over a broad gamut of mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics such as aerodynamic drag, adhesion, heat regulation, friction, elasticity, porosity, density, electrical conductivity, and visual appearance.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Nosang Myung" src="/images/myung.jpg?ox=" alt="Nosang Myung" width="120" height="180" /><img class="img_R" title="Elaine Haberer" src="/images/haberer.jpg" alt="Elaine Haberer" width="120" height="180" />Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering Elaine Haberer is principal investigator on the project "Low-cost label-free whispering gallery mode electrospun optical biosensor for simultaneous detection of multiple biomolecules," which earned $300,000 in NSF funding. Along with co-P.I. Nosang Myung, professor and chair of the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, their project will address societal needs for robust and sensitive biosensors which are low-cost, readily manufacturable, and are able to sense many biomolecules at a time. A sensitive, fiber-based optical platform in which a change in emitted light wavelength signals the presence and amount of the target biomolecule will be used. Within this platform, multiple sensors will be integrated into a small area to create high density biosensor array which can concurrently detect multiple biomolecules from the same small sample volume.</p>
<p><img class="img_R" title="Ertem Tuncel" src="/images/etuncel.jpg" alt="Ertem Tuncel" width="120" height="180" />Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Ertem Tuncel was awarded a $280,717 grant for his project "Sensors That Make Sense: Peak-Power, Energy, and Delay Constrained Networks." Over the next decade, the number of machines and sensors connected to the Internet is expected to explode, creating the so called Internet of Things (IoT). It is foreseen that a significant portion of the quintillions of bytes of data that will be generated every day by IoT will be processed and transmitted using complexity, power, and energy constrained sensor nodes. For the sake of mathematical analysis, these practical constraints are usually relaxed or completely ignored, thereby simplifying the problem at hand, sometimes even to the extent that allows one to obtain closed-form solutions. The main goal of Tuncel's research project is to question such simplifications commonly made among information/communication theory researchers, and to try to formulate more practically relevant problems which can still be analyzed rigorously.</p>
<p><img class="img_L" title="Philip Brisk" src="/images/brisk1.jpg" alt="Philip Brisk" width="120" height="180" /><img class="img_L" title="William Grover" src="/images/wgrover.jpg" alt="William Grover" width="120" height="180" />Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Philip Brisk (P.I.) and Assistant Professor of Bioengineering William Grover (co P.I.) were awarded $300,000 for their project "Design Automation for Paper Microfluidics." Low-cost and disposable paper microfluidic devices are poised to make radical changes in applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, bio-threat detection, and food/water supply and environmental monitoring. Scientists presently must design new devices for each application by hand, which is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Brisk and Grover will adapt the semiconductor industry design methodologies to paper microfluidic technologies, while leveraging standard equipment such as inkjet printers and paper cutters for fabrication. The project will lower the barrier-to-entry for users of paper microfluidic devices, and will promote their widespread use among scientists.</p>
